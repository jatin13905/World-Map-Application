-> About This Project

This simple React application uses Leaflet Maps to show icon markers for all of the world's main cities. The markers are filled in using data from a JSON file that is part of the React Application and gives Leaflet the following:

- City ID
- City Name
- Country Name
- Latitude
- Longitude
